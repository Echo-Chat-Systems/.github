## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We here at Echo-Chat-Systems are a duo (sometimes trio) of developers who aim to make communications systems open source, eaisly accessable, and public.

### Our Story

@InactiveGaming13 and I (@Yuki-42) have been developing real-time chat apps since mid 2022 (with varying degrees of sucess) mostly for the use of our own social groups. Our first ever project was Disbroad V1, a simple TKinter & WebSocket app made to facilitate live-chats with the rest of our friend group while at school because shcool emails were too slow. There were so many issues with this app, ranging from the fact we didn't know JSON existed (yes, really) to the intermitent connection issues and the fact one person in our friend group couldn't use it on his iPad. 

With young ambition we discarded Disbroad V1 and began work on V2, our next attempt at making a functional chat app. This time we decided to make our app use the newfangled power of the web! As usual we dove right into our IDEs without a care in the world for trivial things like planning or design paradigms. We couldn't even make it through to the finish line for Disbroad V2 due to a combination of lack of planning and significantly increased school responsiblities. 

From there came the idea to make TechCrewChat, a system meant for internal use in the school's student run audio-visual production team for school events, due to several events in which 2-Way radios were somewhat ineffective due to extreme volume levels. This was our first real foray into developing an application meant for a very specific purpose with a real userbase, real user feedback, real people trying to break our systems (we appreciate the bug testing Sam), and real purposeful use. We managed to cobble together a system that worked more often than it didn't (marginally) using code that we had written for Disbroad V2, stackoverflow, GitHub Copilot, and many hours of head vs desk matchups. It is true that the system did have several issues, but the core functionality of the chat app worked consistently and across all devices. Unfortunately our success was not to last, with again increases in school responsibilities (entering our last year of school) and social changes, the project was put on the backburner. Occasional commits continued for a few months before the stream of incoming commits went dry. This was followed shortly by our graduation from high school ðŸ˜Ž and entering the adult world ðŸ˜¢. 

Echo-Chat is our next foray into chat app making, and we've learned a **lot** of lessons from planning out a project thoughouly, database design, webapp design, propper cryptography, and more. We hope to make something that can function as a viable alternative to apps such as Discord, providing the same base features without massive monetisation. Planning has been underway since mid 2024 and is still ongoing! We have started some small dev projects (mostly during planning, so they are out of date) but are planning on beginning dev work as soon as we have a finalised scope, architecture, feature set, and well- most other things...

We plan on the following features being available at launch:
- End-To-End encryption available for **all** chats, not just DMs
- Self-Hosting availability
- Inter-Host logins, allowing you to use your offical account on your own server
- & more...

## Update! 13/07/2025

Dev work has begun on our inital concept for a single-executable server (we aren't aming for the moon yet). As of 3:42am AEST today, the server lives for the first time! Words cannot begin to explain how excited I am at the sight of a single console screen. Work is progressing at a very significant rate and I hope to have our first prototype out in less than 2 months.
